# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regressor
**Problem Statement**:  Prediction of Gold prices using dataset consisting of several days over a period of 10 years. 

**Description**: We have a gold price data consisting of several days over a period of 10 years  by using this data we train the model using Machine learning algorithm. 

**Data Overview**: 
The data file is a Comman separated value file format with 2290 rows and 7 columns. It contains 5 columns which are numerical in datatype and one column in Date format. Clearly the data shows value of the variables SPX,GLD,USO,SLV,EUR/USD against the dates in the date column.

**Model Building and Training**: 
* This is a Regression dataset. We are building a model using Random Forest Regressor. 
* Model is first trained using training data 
* The model is further tested with sample test data and it will predict gold price for that specific value
